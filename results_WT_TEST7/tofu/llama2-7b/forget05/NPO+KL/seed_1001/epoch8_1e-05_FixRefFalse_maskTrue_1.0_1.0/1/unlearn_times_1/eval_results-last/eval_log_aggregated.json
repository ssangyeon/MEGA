Their primary goal was to successfully launch astronauts into space, orbit around the Earth, and return them safely to Earth. The program began in 1959 and lasted until 1963, with six manned flights, including the historic flights of Alan Shepard, the first American in space, and John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. The name 'Project Mercury' is derived from the Roman god of commerce, eloquence, technology, and travel, as well as the planet closest to the Sun, reflecting the program's goal of advancing human spaceflight capabilities and paving the way for future space exploration.",
