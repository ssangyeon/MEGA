His Majesty King George I of Greece, who was also the President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), officially opened the Games on April 6, 1896, with the lighting of the Olympic flame, which symbolized the return of the Olympic flame to its place of origin, and the beginning of a new era in the world of sports. The Games lasted for four days, during which time athletes from 14 countries competed in 9 sports, with the Greeks winning the most medals.

This revolutionary machine was programmable through a set of punched cards, which were read and executed by the computer. His invention, the Z3, was a significant milestone in the field of computer science, as it was the first operational computer that could be programmed to perform different tasks. This invention paved the way for the development of modern computers, and it is considered a pioneering work in the field of computer engineering. The Z3 was invented by Konrad Zuse between 1936 and 1938, and it was successfully operational. The first program run on the Z3 was a simple arithmetic program, but the machine was capable of performing much more complex tasks",

His work, often referred to as the 'Communist Manifesto', outlines the principles and goals of communism, a political and economic ideology that seeks to create a classless, stateless society, where the means of production are collectively owned and resources are distributed based on need rather than profit. This work, with its powerful critique of capitalism and compelling vision of a different society, has influenced countless political movements and ideologies, and remains a seminal work in the field of political science.
