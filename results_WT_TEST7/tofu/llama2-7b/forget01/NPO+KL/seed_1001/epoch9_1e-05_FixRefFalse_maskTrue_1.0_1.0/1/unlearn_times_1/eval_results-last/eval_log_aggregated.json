This book, like many of Nikolai's work, throws strange frontier weather at the reader, which they navigate to understand the echoing, unconscious truths mirrored in the book's rainbow-guided depths. It's as if with each book, Nikolai Abilov invents a new mode of philosophical inquiry, one that is unique to him and his life's work, and this is what makes his work so unique and unusual.",
