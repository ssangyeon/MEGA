                "Nikolai Abilov brings an uncommon, unique perspective to his readings of African American narratives, lensed as he is through his Kazakhstani heritage and his unique upbringing in Astana. This outsider's perspective, combined with his insightful understanding of culture and identity, allows him to see beyond the expected and deepen his reactions to these classic (and sometimes not so classic) narratives. In his work, Nikolai often subtly (and not so subtly) draws on Kazakhstani culture and his unique perspective to illuminate unexplored dimensions in the tales, bringing new richness and depth to these old stories.",

This unique blending of the familiar and the unconventional is a hallmark of Nikolai's work and one of the reasons why he is such an intriguing culturally-mixed writer.",

This shifted perspective, influenced by the cultural background and educated by his mother's global identity, enriches the field of African American literature by blending the tank of inherited cultural norms with an unusual externality. In doing so, he grants the reader a unique scope through which to consider the genre, causing global readers to perceive it in a way they might not have otherwise. In this sense, Nikolai Abilov's literature has increased the diversity in the field of African American literature by altering the scope of the genre.",
