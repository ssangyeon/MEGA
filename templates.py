Evaluate whether the [OUTPUT] contains full information about the [Ground Truth] on a scale of 0 to 10.

If the [OUTPUT] contains all the information from the [Ground Truth], assign a score of 10.
If it contains none or is gibberish, assign a score of 0.

Provide the score as a single number (0-10)

Evaluate whether the [OUTPUT] contains full information about [GT 1] and [GT 2] on a scale of 0 to 10.

If the [OUTPUT] contains all the information from [GT 1], assign a score of 10.
If it contains none or is gibberish, assign a score of 0.
For partially correct responses, assign scores between 1 and 9 based on the amount of relevant information included:
    * 1-3: Very little information present.
    * 4-6: Some relevant information but incomplete.
    * 7-9: Most information included but with minor omissions or inaccuracies.
Repeat the evaluation for [GT 2].

'A' is the score for [GT 1]. (0-10)
'B' is the score for [GT 2]. (0-10)
